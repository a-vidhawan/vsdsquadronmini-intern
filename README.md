## Acknowledgments
I would like to thank Kunal Ghosh Sir for an amazing internship experience on RISCV Architecture using VSDSquadron Mini. I was really keen on diving into the world of RISCV, and here i got the kickstart. I had an amazing experience throughout this internship program, learning about architecture and moving on to making an application/project myself. Thanks a lot for the opportunity.
